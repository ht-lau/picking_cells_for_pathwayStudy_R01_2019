I previously wanted to have the essential pathway component(s) to express highly. However, when I think more about it, I feel that it is not right. Like EGFR, if it expressed at a high level, it auto-phosphorylate, so one will not be able to induce or shut it off. 
So I think they should be expressed at a median level.
